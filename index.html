<h1> KAWHI ANTHONY LEONARD </h1>

<h2>KAWHI'S ORIGINS</h2>
<p style="color:black;">
Kawhi, <strong>drafted by the Pacers in 2011 and immediately traded to the Spurs</strong>. On the Spurs he went on to win a championship against prime LeBron and the 2014 Heat, where he won Finals MVP at only 22 years old — becoming the 3rd youngest to win Finals MVP. But his career soon became shaky due to injuries he would sustain consistently in the following seasons. The media turned on him and he was soon traded off the team.

After <strong>Kawhi was traded to the Raptors</strong>, many doubted him as he was coming off a heavy injury season where he only played 18 games. This didn't stop him — he led that team to their first championship in his first and only year there, becoming a symbol of resilience and triumph. He did this with the help of his amazing teammates that included Kyle Lowry, Fred Vanvleet, Pascal Siakam, and OG Anunoby. Despite his success, this would be his only year playing with the Raptors. </p>p>
<p style="color:blue;">  The next year after winning this championship he <strong>signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.</strong> On the Clippers Kawhi has had teammates like Jamess Harden, Russel Westbrook, and Paul George. But sadly year after year he continues to face injuries tht continue to leave people wondering how many years he has left in the league. But despite all of the injuries and noise from the media, Kawhi continues to come back better each time. Since his departure from the Raptors he has also had no luck in doing good in the playoffs, due to missing games in the playoffs, which leaves fans to think that he mat not win another championship by the end of his career.

<h2>ACCOLADES</h2>
<p style="color:red;">
Kawhi is approaching the end of his career with great accolades: 2× DPOY, 2× Champion, 2× Finals MVP, 6× All-Star, 3× All-NBA First Team, 3× All-Defensive First Team, and 1× All-Star MVP. But most importantly, he is retiring as my GOAT. Starting as a kid from Riverside California and eventuallly amounting to a superstar and basketball legend, Kawhi will always be a figure that I look up to.
