<h1> KAWHI ANTHONY LEONARD </h1>

<h2>KAWHI'S ORIGINS</h2>
<p style="color:red;">
Kawhi, <strong>drafted by the Pacers in 2011 and immediately traded to the Spurs</strong>. On the Spurs he went on to win a championship against prime LeBron and the 2014 Heat, where he won Finals MVP at only 22 years old — becoming the 3rd youngest to win Finals MVP. But his career soon became shaky due to injuries he would sustain consistently in the following seasons. The media turned on him and he was soon traded off the team.

After <strong>Kawhi was traded to the Raptors</strong>, many doubted him as he was coming off a heavy injury season where he only played 18 games. This didn't stop him — he led that team to their first championship in his first and only year there, becoming a symbol of resilience and triumph. He did this with the help of his amazing teammates that included Kyle Lowry, Fred Vanvleet, Pascal Siakam, and OG Anunoby. The next year after winning this championship he signed with the Clippers whrre he hasn't seen as much success and has struggled with injuries.

<h2>ACCOLADES</h2>
<p style="color:red;">
Kawhi is approaching the end of his career with great accolades: 2× DPOY, 2× Champion, 2× Finals MVP, 6× All-Star, 3× All-NBA First Team, 3× All-Defensive First Team, and 1× All-Star MVP. But most importantly, he is retiring as my GOAT.
